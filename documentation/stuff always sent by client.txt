This is a sample of what the client always sends on each request (after login):

{
	ruv: 1919004959,
	deviceType: 1,
	systemVersion: '13.5.1',
	appVersion: '4.0.0'
}

ruv - Random Unsigned Value
	+ Is just a random unsigned value
	+ Likely prevents duplicate requests from being processed
	+ When injected with random numbers, no requests were dropped

deviceType - Type of device
	+ Probably 1 = ios, and others like it

systemVersion - Operating system version

appVersion - Application version
